    """Compute reviewer status and wait time from timeline.

    The status determines what action (if any) the reviewer needs to take:
    - REVIEW: Initial review needed (requested but not yet reviewed)
    - RE_REVIEW: Re-review needed (new commits after previous review)
    - HOLD: Waiting on author (reviewer requested changes, no new commits)
    - APPROVED: Reviewer approved (no action needed)

    Args:
        timeline_events: List of timeline events from the PR (sorted by timestamp)
        reviewer: GitHub username of the reviewer

    Returns:
        Tuple of (status, wait_start_time) where wait_start_time is when
        the wait period began (meaning varies by status):
        - REVIEW: Time since review was requested (or PR created)
        - RE_REVIEW: Time since new commits were pushed
        - HOLD: Time since reviewer requested changes
