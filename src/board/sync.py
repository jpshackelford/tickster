"""Board configuration sync between local and gist.

This module implements bidirectional sync of board configurations,
enabling persistence across ephemeral environments.

Merge algorithm:
- For boards in both local and gist: newer updated_at wins
- If timestamps are equal and content differs, a deterministic
  lexicographic tie-breaker chooses one copy so all clients converge
- For boards only in local: add to gist (unless gist has newer tombstone)
- For boards only in gist: add locally (unless local has newer tombstone)
- Tombstones propagate deletions across sync
